# Find Me App

By Dina Ayoub

## Description

This app shows you a list of their contacts, with two buttons that will show up as appropriate for the given contact: SMS and Email.
When you click on either of those buttons, the app will open up either a text message or an email to that contact and provide them with your location data (latitude and longitude) so you can easily share your location.

Note: If your contact, for example, doesn't have a phone number, you'll only see the Email button
